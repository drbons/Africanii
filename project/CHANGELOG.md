# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Signup Flow:** Fixed an issue where step 2 of the signup process (role selection) was not properly handling user selection
  - Simplified the `handleRoleSelect` function to use a single update attempt instead of multiple retries with exponential backoff
  - Added better UI feedback with focus states on role selection buttons to make selection more apparent
  - Updated authentication flow to properly navigate users based on their selected role
  - Modified email signup to not set a default role, requiring users to explicitly choose one
  - Enhanced profile update logic to continue with the correct navigation path after role selection
  - Fixed issue where users would get stuck on step 2 but still be signed in when accessing other parts of the app

### Technical Details
- The race condition in the role selection process has been addressed by:
  1. Simplifying the profile update retry mechanism
  2. Immediately updating local state for better UX
  3. Ensuring navigation happens regardless of profile update success
  4. Adding clear error handling with fallback navigation paths
  5. Updating the useEffect hooks to properly check user authentication state and role

### Developer Notes
- If role selection issues persist, check for network connectivity problems as the system is designed to move forward with navigation even when profile updates fail to sync
- Firebase profile updates may still succeed on the server even when the client receives no response
- The system now handles offline mode more gracefully by allowing users to proceed with the flow
