# Performance Optimization Checklist

This guide provides a comprehensive checklist for optimizing the performance of the Africanii application.

## Running Performance Audits

1. **Lighthouse Audit**
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Go to the "Lighthouse" tab
   - Select "Performance" and "Mobile"
   - Click "Generate report"
   - Look for key metrics: First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive

2. **Chrome Performance Profiling**
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Go to the "Performance" tab
   - Click the record button and interact with the site for 10-15 seconds
   - Stop recording and analyze the flame chart for long tasks

3. **Firebase Performance**
   - Check Firebase console for performance insights

## Common Performance Issues

### 1. Image Optimization
- [ ] Images are properly sized and compressed
- [ ] Image loading strategy uses appropriate `loading="lazy"` attributes
- [ ] Consider using WebP format where supported
- [ ] Firebase Storage images have proper caching headers

### 2. Firebase Optimization
- [ ] Firebase resources are loaded lazily
- [ ] Firestore queries are optimized with proper indexes
- [ ] Batch reads/writes where appropriate
- [ ] Data is structured for efficient querying

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Check bundle size with `npm run build && npx vite build --report`
- [ ] Ensure code splitting is working correctly
- [ ] Verify that large dependencies are properly chunked
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies and code

### 4. Rendering Optimization
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary renders (check React DevTools Profiler)
- [ ] Implement proper memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- [ ] Virtualize large lists

## Performance Improvement Steps

If you encounter slow loading times:

1. **Check Network Performance**
   - Look for slow resource loading in Network tab
   - Verify CORS configuration is correct for Firebase Storage
   - Check for request waterfall issues (sequential loading)

2. **Optimize Critical Rendering Path**
   - Ensure key UI elements load first
   - Defer non-critical JS and CSS
   - Consider server-side rendering for critical pages

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Review Firestore queries for inefficiency
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Consider local storage for frequently accessed data

4. **Code Splitting Improvements**
   - Ensure routes are properly code-split
   - Preload routes based on likely user navigation
   - Consider using dynamic imports for large components

## Build Optimization Techniques

- For production builds, run:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

- Use build analyzer:
```bash
npx vite-bundle-visualizer
```

## Testing Environment vs Production

Remember that performance in development mode will differ from production due to:
- Development mode React warnings and features
- Lack of minification and optimization
- Hot Module Reloading overhead

Always test performance optimizations in a production build.
